        "1. Enumerate filepaths for the season of interest.\n",
        "2. For each unique filepath, read in the *substitutions* and *playerStats* files as dataframes.\n",
        "3. Using the substitutions file, classify players to positions.\n",
        "4. Add the player positions to the playerStats dataframe.\n",
        "5. For each position, group by position and calculate the means of each statistic.\n",
        "6. Rate these means against the means of the previous week. This accounts for overall changes in quality in the league.\n",
        "7. Each player's individual metrics are rated against the result produced in the previous step and stored in a list in a dictionary.\n",
        "9. The league average dictionary is updated to prepare for next week.\n",
        "10. The following storage items are required: Dict(League average previous week and rating) & Dict(Player's ratings weekly)"
